## Quick start

Download and install the latest Sentry plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install sentry
```

Configure your [credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/sentry#credentials) and [config file](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/sentry#configuration).

### Configuring Sentry Credentials

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/sentry.spc`:

You may specify the Auth Token to authenticate:

- `auth_token`: Specify the authentication token.

```hcl
connection "sentry_via_auth_token" {
  plugin   = "sentry"
  auth_token  = "de70c93ecc594a0eb52463bd8f1e6d0b203615621e724762b3e5a9d82be291e9xfWdDNqwZPngS"
}
```

or through environment variables

```sh
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="de70c93ecc594a0eb52463bd8f1e6d0b203615621e724762b3e5a9d82be291e9xfWdDNqwZPngS"
```

or through the active credentials from the Sentry CLI. You can run `sentry-cli login` to set up these credentials.

```hcl
connection "sentry" {
  plugin = "sentry"
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List your Sentry organizations:

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  is_default,
  require_2fa,
  open_membership,
  default_role
from
  sentry_organization;
```

```
+------------------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+
| id               | name   | is_default | require_2fa | open_membership | default_role |
+------------------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+
| 4504948474773504 | Turbot | false      | false       | true            | admin        |
+------------------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+
```
