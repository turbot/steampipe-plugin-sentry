## Quick start

Install the plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```shell
steampipe plugin install sentry
```

Configure different methods for authentication in `~/.steampipe/config/sentry.spc`:

```hcl
connection "sentry" {
  plugin = "sentry"

  # `auth_token` - Create an authentication token in the Sentry Console for use.
  # Console path - settings -> account -> api -> auth-tokens
  # Can also be set with the SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable.
  # auth_token = "de70c93ecc594a0eb52463bd8f1e6d0b203615621e724762b3e5a9d82be291e9xfWdDNqwZPngS"

  # If no credentials are specified, the plugin will use Sentry CLI authentication.
}
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Query your organization:

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  is_default,
  require_2fa,
  open_membership,
  default_role
from
  sentry_organization;
```

```
+------------------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+
| id               | name   | is_default | require_2fa | open_membership | default_role |
+------------------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+
| 4504948474773504 | Turbot | false      | false       | true            | admin        |
+------------------+--------+------------+-------------+-----------------+--------------+
```
